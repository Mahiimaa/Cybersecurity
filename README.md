# Cybersecurity

This repository contains all the cybersecurity projects I am building as I learn and improve my skills.  
Each folder includes a small project, script, or practice exercise related to security.

## Projects
- **SOC-Lab** – Basic SOC and monitoring practice  
- **Vulnerability-Assessment** – Simple vulnerability scanning exercises  
- **Web-App-Security** – Web security practice (XSS, SQLi, etc.)  
- **Writeups** – Notes and explanations from labs or challenges  
- **Certifications** – Proof of completed courses and badges  

## Purpose
I created this repo to track my learning and build a portfolio for future opportunities in cybersecurity.

## 🛠️ Technologies I’ll be using
- Linux  
- Python  
- Networking basics  
- Security tools (Nmap, Burp Suite, Wireshark, etc.)

## Status
I am still a beginner, and this repo will grow as I learn more.
